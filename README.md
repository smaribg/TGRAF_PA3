### Introduction
You play as a goblin called Tim. You can run around the castle 
and collect golden coins to feel better about yourself, because 
goblins are terrible people (can we use the word people? I don't know).

### Controls
You can move around using the WASD keys and you can move the camera using the mouse. To increase the mouse sensitivity hold the R button. To decrease it hold the F button. To quit the game press the Esc button.
